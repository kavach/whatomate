## Managing Canned Responses

Navigate to **Settings > Canned Responses** to create and manage your responses.

### Creating a Canned Response

<Steps>

1. **Click "Add Response"**

   Open the canned responses settings and click the "Add Response" button.

2. **Enter Response Details**

   Fill in the following fields:
   - **Name**: A descriptive name (e.g., "Welcome Message")
   - **Shortcut**: Optional quick-access code (e.g., `welcome`)
   - **Category**: Select a category for organization
   - **Content**: The actual message text

3. **Add Placeholders (Optional)**

   Include dynamic placeholders in your content:
   - `{{contact_name}}` - Replaced with the contact's name
   - `{{phone_number}}` - Replaced with the contact's phone number

4. **Save**

   Click "Create" to save your response.

</Steps>

### Categories

Organize your responses into categories for easier navigation:

| Category | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| **Greetings** | Welcome messages, initial contact responses |
| **Support** | Common support replies, troubleshooting steps |
| **Sales** | Product information, pricing, promotions |
| **Closing** | Thank you messages, conversation endings |
| **General** | Miscellaneous responses |

## Using Canned Responses in Chat

There are two ways to insert canned responses while chatting:

### Method 1: Picker Button

1. Click the **canned responses icon** (message bubble) next to the emoji button in the chat input area
2. Search or browse through your responses
3. Click a response to insert it into the message input
4. Edit if needed, then send

### Method 2: Slash Commands

1. Type `/` followed by your shortcut in the chat input (e.g., `/welcome`)
2. A picker will appear showing matching responses
3. Select the response to insert it
4. Edit if needed, then send

<Aside type="tip">
  Slash commands are the fastest way to insert responses. Create memorable shortcuts like `/hi`, `/thanks`, `/hours` for your most-used responses.
</Aside>

## Placeholders

Make your responses personal by using dynamic placeholders that get replaced with actual contact data when inserted.

### Available Placeholders

| Placeholder | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `{{contact_name}}` | Contact's profile name | "John Smith" |
| `{{phone_number}}` | Contact's phone number | "+1234567890" |

### Example

**Canned Response Content:**
```
Hello {{contact_name}}! Thank you for reaching out to our support team. How can I help you today?
```

**After Insertion (for contact "Sarah"):**
```
Hello Sarah! Thank you for reaching out to our support team. How can I help you today?
```

<Aside type="note">
  If a placeholder value is not available (e.g., contact has no name), it will be replaced with a default value or left empty.
</Aside>

## Usage Tracking

The system automatically tracks how often each response is used. This helps you:
- Identify your most popular responses
- See usage counts on each response card
- Responses are sorted by usage count (most used first)

## Access Control

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Create, edit, delete, and use responses |
| **Manager** | Create, edit, delete, and use responses |
| **Agent** | Use responses only (cannot create/edit/delete) |

<Aside type="tip">
  Agents can use all canned responses in the chat, but only admins and managers can manage them in settings.
</Aside>

## Best Practices

1. **Keep responses concise** - WhatsApp messages work best when brief and to the point

2. **Use meaningful shortcuts** - Choose shortcuts that are easy to remember (`/hi`, `/price`, `/hours`)

3. **Personalize with placeholders** - Using `{{contact_name}}` makes responses feel more personal

4. **Organize by category** - Group similar responses together for easier discovery

5. **Review and update regularly** - Keep responses current and accurate

6. **Train your team** - Make sure agents know about available responses and shortcuts
